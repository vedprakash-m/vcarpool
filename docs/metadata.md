  export NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="https://carpool.vedprakash.net"
  export NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL="https://carpool.vedprakash.net/api"
  ```
- ‚úÖ **Next.js Configuration Update**: Modified `frontend/next.config.js` to explicitly include authentication environment variables with defaults:
  ```javascript
  env: {
    // Authentication configuration - explicitly include these
    NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_LEGACY_AUTH: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_LEGACY_AUTH || 'true',
    NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ENTRA_AUTH: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ENTRA_AUTH || 'true',
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL || 'https://carpool.vedprakash.net',
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL || 'https://carpool.vedprakash.net/api',
